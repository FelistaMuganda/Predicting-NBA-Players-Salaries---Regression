# Predicting-NBA-Players-Salaries---SQLdf & Regression

The objective of the project was to predict an NBA player's salary and find key characteristics that drive these salaries, e.g. type of baskets scored, number of baskets scored etc. through statistical modelling.

Five years data from basketball leagues was obtained from a sports website, cleaned, tables describing different aspects of the players joined with SQLdf, prediction done with linear regression, and a log transformation on dependent variable (Salaries) implemented to get better fitting model.

AIC and BIC techniques were used for model reduction
